# Development

For website development contracts, please reach out via email (**ivan.a.neto@hotmail.com**) to discuss pricing and particular needs. Some common pricing is included below, though it is subject to change given particular needs.

**Note:** for projects requiring **high infrastructure cost**, you must provide funding through an approved payment provider.

## Contract

A typical contract includes the following:

#### Deliverables

A list of items - features - that your website must have. These follow a function-over-form framework where the main features will be added.

The styling of the website can be added additionally as a final deliverable with input from the client.

#### Timeline

A timeline of deliverables is extremely important. It includes soft and hard deadlines for each deliverable, displaying accountability for the developer.

**Note:** I require that we have a "discovery" meeting where we outline the timeline for your website.

#### Soft Deadline

While deadlines are not often missed, it is important to keep flexibility in mind when creating a complex product. Soft deadlines allow you to have confidence in my deliverable timeline, and to adjust the timeline in the case that these are missed.

#### Hard Deadline

They must be followed strictly to ensure accountability and correct expectations by the client. In rare cases, with your explicit consent, we may move these forward for prompt delivery.

#### Maintenance Option

The option to maintain your product month-to-month. Websites often break, causing your products to be unseen. This option ensures that you are satisfied with the development work by fixing any issues given a small fee (typically less than $6 per month).

If you want me to develop something for you - website, game, or any such product - we will make a contract based on your needs and the skill required to create the product.

**Note:** I typically require plenty of communication - via email, phone call, or text as discussed - to ensure that your specifications and needs are completely met.

## Other Products

Pricing for miscellaneous products varies depending on:

### Complexity

Projects requiring highly complex server/client interactions will require higher initial investment from the developer, requiring higher price.

For projects requiring expensive infrastructure like databses, we mostly work with AWS. We require that you provide funding for these services through a payment provider.

### Scope

Some projects require knowledge from several subject areas. The pricing for the products depends on the knowledge required, and the different interactions between third-party services.

### Budget

We are very flexible. Your budget highly determines the prices in these miscellaneous projects.


### Timeline

For tighter timelines, we incur a fee due to the cost of not working on other projects. Typically this fee is 15%, though may increase depending on the tightness of the deadline.

### Upkeep Requirements

Some projects require constant upkeep, such as fixing bugs. This upkeep requirement may incur a mandatory upkeep fee. The complexity of upkeep determines the upkeep fee amount.
