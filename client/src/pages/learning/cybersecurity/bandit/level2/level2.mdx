# Bandit Level 1 -> 2

The task for this level is to display the contents of a file named `-`, located in the home directory `~` for user `bandit1`.

This file is special in that, because of the name `-`, one cannot simply run the command `cat -`.

Instead, we must provide the correct path, starting with the current directory:

## Solution

`cat ./-`

<div class="grid">
	<img className="articleImage" src={getImageUrl("learning/cybersecurity/bandit/level2/term1.png")} alt="" ></img>
</div>
