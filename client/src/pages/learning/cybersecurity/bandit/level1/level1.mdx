# Bandit Level 0 -> 1

The task for this level is to display the contents of a file named `-`, located in the home directory `~` for user `bandit1`.

This file is special in that, because of the name `-`, one cannot simply run the command `cat -`.

## Solution

<DropDownSection title="click for spoiler">

Instead of `cat -`, we must provide the correct path, starting with the current directory:

`cat ./-`

<div class="halfgrid">
	<img className="halfgriditem emphasis4 dark card" src={getImageUrl("learning/cybersecurity/bandit/level2/term1.png")} alt="" ></img>
</div>

</DropDownSection>
